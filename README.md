# Prioritizing Allocation of Legal Assistance for At-Risk Tenants in Virgina

## Overview
Breakdown of time periods for our training and testing sets can be found [here](./data/time_splits.csv). 

[Here](./features.txt) is our full list of generated features. 

[Here](./predicted_tracts.csv) is the list of tracts generated by our best model.

[Here](./feature_importances.csv) are the feature importances of our best model. 


## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook, titled predicting_va_evictions.ipynb , walks through the process of loading the data, creating the features, selecting the models to run, and finally runnning the models. The notebook calls pipeline_evictions.py, which handles data loading, processing, feature generation, and creation of test/train datasets. It also calls ml_loop_evictions.py, which passes training and testing datasets through a given list of models. The iterate_over_models_and_training_sets() function returns a table with results across train test splits over time and performance metrics (baseline, precision and recall at different thresholds 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% and AUC_ROC).

## Data

The csv used in the analysis can be found in data/tracts. The Jupyter Notebook, data-exploration.ipynb, contains visualizations of distributions of several continuous features as well as exploration into missing data.
